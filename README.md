# restaurant-redux-toolkit
> Study project

Project was created just to practice Redux Toolkit that elegantly replaces more complicated Redux. Even in the [Redux official documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) it is written that it's better to use Toolkit, so it is good to know how to use it.

```bash
npm install
```
To run application on your local machine type: 
```bash
npm run start
```

## Status
Project is not perfect and there is lots that could be improved, but for me this project is finished. I just wanted to test this library a bit. If I forgot how to implement Redux Toolkit in the future, I will come back to this repo and copy parts of the code I need. :)
